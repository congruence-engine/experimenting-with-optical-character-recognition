# Data
This folder contains data created by the Congruence Engine project as part of the project's investigation into the different uses of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). 

The folder [worralls_1910_images](https://github.com/congruence-engine/experimenting-with-optical-character-recognition/tree/main/data/worralls_1910_images) contains example images from the 1910 Worrall's *Yorkshire Textile Directory* (pocket edition), which is representative of the kinds of documents that the project worked with.
