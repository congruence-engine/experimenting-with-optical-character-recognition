Process the following list of manufacturers and output a CSV file with the following columns: Companies, Addresses, Company Types, and Bracketed Information. The Company Types should be extracted from the headings in the input text (e.g., 'BLANKET MANUFACTURERS', 'bleachers'). For items where there are no brackets, write 'none' in the Bracketed Information column. Some items will include commas in the values - in such cases enclose the value in double-quote characters. Pay attention to business names that end in 'Ltd' or 'Limited', and ensure that this is included in the companies field. Do not include any other text in your response, including explanations, preambles etc.
