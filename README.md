# Experimenting with Optical Character Recognition 

## Short summary

The purpose of this repo is to collect details about various efforts across the Congruence Engine to experiment with Optical Character Recognition technology. It includes google colab notebooks and pipelines used by the project to harness OCR tools, mostly with the intention of extracting raw text for subsequent analysis, as well as post-processing. 

## Research question
- What tools are available for extracting text from historic materials, and how are these changing in the wake of Large Language Models?
